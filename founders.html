      <h2 style="color:#8bc34a;">John Gilmore</h2>
      <p>John Gilmore is the Executive Director of the Autism Action Network, a national, not-profit, grassroots advocacy organization that influences legislation and public policy on a wide range of issues impacting the autism community. The Autism Action Network works at the state, federal and occasionally the local level to positively influence the lives of people with autism, their families and communities. The Autism Action Network is active in all 50 states and has taken action on thousands of bills across the US.<br>
        <br>
        In New York, key legislation Mr. Gilmore has worked on include introducing and passing a bill in 2005 that outlawed the use of mercury in vaccines given to children under three and pregnant women, passing a bill in 2006 that outlawed health insurance discrimination against people with autism, obtaining a veto of a bill that would have made autism health insurance reform impossible in 2010, and finally passing autism health insurance reform in 2011. During 2106 Autism Action Network was instrumental in protecting religious exemptions in New York schools, and pressuring the New York Regents to eliminate passing Regents Exams as a requirement to earn a high school diploma. Mr. Gilmore coordinated walks for Autism United in 2007 and 2008.<br>
        <br>
        Mr. Gilmore has a Master’s Degree in Public Policy from the Graduate School of Public Policy at UC Berkeley. He lives in Long Beach, NY with his wife, Jennifer, and two teenage sons. His son Luke is diagnosed with autism.</p>
